FINITE AUTOMATA DOCUMENTATION:

    Class FiniteAutomata:
        -initial fields:
            self.Q = Q - Finite set of states
            self.E = E - Set of Input Symbols
            self.q0 = q0 - Initial State
            self.F = F - Set of Finl States
            self.S = S - Transition function

        -methods:

            1. checkDFA:
                - checks if the FA is a deterministic finite automaton
                    - checks that for an element in the transition set there are no more than one value per key
                
            2. checkAccepted:
                -starts from initial state and goes down the transition dictionary
                    - checking if the element is in the final set of states F. if it is then the sequence is checkAccepted
                    - otherwise go further in the dictionary
                    - if nothing is found returns false
           
            3. readFAFromFile:
                reads from file finitie automata
                - see FA.in for example
            

    Finite automata read from file:
        Q = A B C
        E = 0 1
        q0 = A
        F = A C
        S =
            (A,0) => A
            (A,1) => C
            (B,0) => B
            (C,1) => B
